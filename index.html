        <br>
If I have to live my life without you near me <br>
The days would all be empty <br>
The nights would seem so long <br>
With you I see forever, oh, so clearly <br>
I might have been in love before <br>
But it never felt this strong <br>
<br>

Our dreams are young and we both know <br>
They'll take us where we want to go <br>
Hold me now, touch me now <br>
I don't want to live without you <br>

<br>
If the road ahead is not so easy <br>
Our love will lead the way for us <br>
Like a guiding star <br>
I'll be there for you if you should need me <br>
You don't have to change a thing <br>
I love you just the way you are <br>
<br>

So come with me and share the view <br>
I'll help you see forever too <br>
Hold me now, touch me now <br>
I don't want to live without you <br>
<br>

Nothing's gonna change my love for you <br>
You oughta know by now how much I love you <br>
One thing you can be sure of <br>
I'll never ask for more than your love <br>
<br>
Nothing's gonna change my love for you <br>
You oughta know by now how much I love you <br>
The world may change my whole life through <br>
But nothing's gonna change my love for You........ <br>
